The Board Room is a website for board game lovers who would like to purchase board games as well as join monthly meetups to meet new people and play games. The website name is a play on the fact that we play games when we are bored and also the fact that this is exclusively a board game website.

## User Experience (UX)

## Features

### Features Across All Pages
* The logo is designed so that the user can click on it and be redirected to the home page (index.html). This is a standard in many websites and is therefore included. Furthermore, the logo is consistent on all pages.

* The footer includes logos of each of the respective social media. When the user clicks on the link, they are redirected into a new tab. The footer section has a brown border on the top to clearly distinguish itself from the section above.

* The nav bar is also consistent on all pages. It changes to opposite colours when the user hovers over the text. The user will be sure they are selecting the correct page they require.

### Home Page

* The home page greets the user with a hero image of a chess board. This was chosen due the popularity of the game and the fact that it is a game that is recognised around the world and in many cultures. There is also a block of text with concise description of the website.

![Hero Image](./documentation/features/Intro-Home%20page.JPG)

* Beneath the hero image, we have the contrasting meet up section. This was to clearly split it up from the introduction as well as to make it eye catching to both new and frequent users. New users will be encouraged to sign up and frequent users will be able to easily find the meet up times in case they need to be reminded. 

* The meet up times are in white bordered boxes which can be clicked. It redirects the user to the sign-up page. When the user hovers over the boxes, colours are once again flipped like in the navigation bar. It is to fit in with the theme of the website.

![Meet Up Section](./documentation/features/meetup-home%20page.JPG)

* The last section (before the footer) involves the reasons to join. This is primarily for new users who have never been to a meet up before. The colours are again contrasted from the meet up to provide clear clarity between the two sections. Furthermore, there is a video which the user can play to see what a meet up can look like. This will encourage the user to see 'what's on' or sign up to The Board Room.

### What's On

* The background image on the What's On page is of dice being thrown. This image was chosen due to its light colours and to remind the user that we have a wide variety of games. 

* The heading of the middle section makes use of the title of the page as well as telling the user what this page involves. 

* On a desktop, the user can hover over each game to find information regarding it. The box has a border in order to distinguish it from the background. A user using a touch-screen device may click on the game to find out the information.

### Sign Up

* Similar to the home page, the background image is of a chess board. The user can find the form to the right of the page in a contrasting brown box. All sections of the form are required and this ensures the user does not accidentally forget to fill out a section.

* Since this page is linked to the meet up section of the homepage, the heading and icons above the form remains the same as the meet up section. This ensures continuity between the two pages. 

* The input fields for the name and email address both include a grey border. Whilst the color scheme for this website is only dark brown and white, the grey ensures the user can see that they are clicking on the correct box. If the borders remained either dark brown or white, the user would not have been able to clearly see which box they hovering over and there would be no contrast involved. 

* To choose which game the user prefers, there is a drop down menu with 4 options. The first one is the default and encourages user to select a game.

* The user has choice between thursday and friday as the meet up days. Since there is no limit on how many a customer can attend, the user may select both using checkboxes. 

* The user can choose to donate a board game but this is entirely optional. Since the user can either donate or not donate, the radio button is used. This ensures only one answer is selected.

## Design

* Throughout the website, two primay colours are used. These are white and dark brown. This was inspired by the colours on a chess board. Furthermore, the brown was chosen since it is an earthy colour and so the user can feel comfortable. 

* There are 3 different images in the background. All images purposely have a light and dark element. For example, the hero image in the homepage is primarily light but with a single brown chess piece. This is eyecatching but also fits in with the more general light and dark theme of the website.

* All clickable links (except the logo and in the footer) changes so that when the user hovers over the text, the colour inverts. Furthermore, the boxes in the What's On page also invert when the user hovers, but they are not clickable (i.e will not link you to another page).

* A single font has been used throughout the website. The font used is Source Sans Pro and is imported from Google Fonts. This was used since it has a clean look and will appeal to modern audiences who may not play games as often.Another font called Permanent Marker was imported and trialled however is not used in the deployed website.
