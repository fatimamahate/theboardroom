The Board Room is a website for board game lovers who would like to purchase board games as well as join monthly meetups to meet new people and play games. The website name is a play on the fact that we play games when we are bored and also the fact that this is exclusively a board game website.

## Features
The logo is designed so that the user can click on it and be redirected to home page (index.html). This is a standard in many websites and is therefore included. Furthermore, the logo is consistent on all pages.

The nav bar is also consistent on all pages. It changes to opposite colours when the user hovers over the text. The user will be sure they are selecting the correct page they require. 

The home page greets the user with a hero image of a chess board. This was chosen due the popularity of the game and the fact that it is a game that is recognised around the world and in many cultures. There is also a block of text with concise description of the website.

Beneath the hero image, we have the contrasting meet up section. This was to clearly split it up from the introduction as well as to make it eye catching to both new and frequent users. New users will be encouraged to sign up and frequent users will be able to easily find the meet up times in case they need to be reminded. 

The meet up times are in white boxes which can be clicked. It redirects the user to the sign-up page. The white boxes once again provides some contrast making it eye catching for the user and can quickly be used to remind the user or redirect the user to the sign up page.

The last section (before the footer) involves the reasons to join. This is primarily for new users who have never been to meet up before. The colours are again contrasted from the meet up to provide clear clarity between the two sections.
